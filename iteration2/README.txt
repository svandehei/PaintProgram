Directions for modifying your current project from iteration 1 to iteration 2:

1. Drop FlashPhotoApp.h and FlashPhotoApp.cpp into your project directory from iteration 1 (or a new copy of iteration 1).
2. Modify your Makefile and main.cpp to build FlashPhoto application.
3. Merge any code changes you need from BrushWorkApp.h and BrushWorkApp.cpp to get the drawing working for FlashPhoto.
